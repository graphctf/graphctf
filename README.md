# GraphCTF

The only API-driven CTF backend for performant and flexible CTF competitions!

## Features

- Designed with performance in mind, GraphCTF easily scales to thousands of simultaneous users.
- Local instances are stateless, so you can round-robin between instances even without a load balancer.
- Uses GraphQL subscriptions instead of polling for enhanced responsiveness and scalability.
- Bring-your-own-frontend! Need a mobile app for an IRL challenge? Want to give people a command line
